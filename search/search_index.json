Logs Method: Most actions triggered in TeamBldr go through a helper function that prepares and organizes the data to save as a log. Purpose: Tracking all activities within the application can be extremely beneficial. The usage information can be extracted via API call or csv export, transformed via technical script or Tableau, and loaded onto a dashboard or online Tableau interface. Based on the result of the ETL flow, analysts can derive meaning from the activity within TeamBldr. For instance, there are statistical models and methods that can employed by examining the client activity within the application and tying it back to the likelihood of that client's willingness to hire. Given the client's tendency towards certain logged actions within Teambldr over others, we can run an analysis on the impact of those logged actions (i.e. profile viewed, interview scheduled) and put together a basic classification model to divide the clients into groups. Once there is a categorization for the client's willingness to hire based on their recorded logged actions, we can run a logistic regression for any client that we want to classify as having high willingness to hire or not.
