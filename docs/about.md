# About TeamBldr

## Inception

> JLM Strategic Talent Partners works extensively with candidates as well as clients. On the candidate-side, there was a need for:

<ul>
<li>Consolidated, uniform resume format</li>
<li>Tracking system outside of the ATS used at the time (<a href="https://www.bullhorn.com/">Bullhorn</a>)</li>
</ul>

On the other hand, for the clients, JLM needed:

<ul>
    <li>Dedicated application for client-side interactions</li>
    <li>Easy methodology for presenting candidates to clients</li>
</ul>

> The above needs motivated the creation of TeamBldr, a dynamic ATS software built with scalability and simplicity at its core.

> TeamBldr started with just the candidate side. There was an initial attempt at incorporating a programmatic resume-parser but the task was deemed overly ambitious and it turned instead into an ATS.

> Concurrently, clients of JLM had been using Google Sheets to go through our candidates. Naturally, we wanted to transition the clients into a robust application to handle the entire hiring process. Thus, the client-side of TeamBldr was constructed to accommodate this need.

## Usage

> The application was initially designed for use by both the employees of JLM and clients.

> Business analysts and relationship specialists manage the candidate pool within the application. Relationship specialists are also responsible for: presenting appropriate candidates to clients, working with the clients to communicate needs and orders, maintaining relationships with candidates, and more.
